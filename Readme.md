# ha runner

Incredibly mininal home assistant command runner. Currently the minimum I need. Might dev more if anyone else finds this.

See the example config TOML for details, expects config file as it's argument.

Expects a long lived token for your home assistant in the env variable `HA_AUTH_TOKEN`.
